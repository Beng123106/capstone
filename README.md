# capstone project
1. I will be creating a 2d top down boss fight game (think hollow knight/cuphead type boss fights). Haven't thought of a title yet
2. My goal for this project is to create a playable and cleanly functioning game that someone could look at and think "damn this is actually really cool". 
3. What I want to have finished by the middle of June is a playable game with sufficient content (not sure what that looks like, but lets say like 3 boss fights)
4.  I will be making this game using pygame

April 6:  
* I will continue learning pygame over the long weekend

April 14:
* learn how to create a 'character' and actually move it with arrow keys
